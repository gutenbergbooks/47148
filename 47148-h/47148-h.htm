<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>


<p>In presenting this book of cheerful counsel to his youthful
friends, and such of the seniors as are not too old to accept
a bit of friendly admonition, the author desires to offer
a word of explanation regarding the history of the making
of this volume.</p>

<p>So many letters have been received from people of all
classes and ages requesting copies of some of the author&rsquo;s
lines best suited for the purpose of engendering a sense of
self-help in the mind of youth, that he deems it expedient to
offer a number of his verses in the present collected form.
While he is indebted to a great array of bright minds for
the prose incidents and inspiration which constitute a large
portion of this volume, he desires to be held personally
responsible for all of the rhymed lines to be found within
these covers.</p>

<p>It may be especially true of advice that &ldquo;it is more
blessed to give than to receive,&rdquo; but it is hoped that in this
present form of tendering friendly counsel the precepts will
be accepted in the same cheerful spirit in which they are
offered.</p>

<p>The author realizes that no one is more urgently in need
of good advice and the intelligence to follow it than is the
writer of these lines, and none cries more earnestly the well-known
truth&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Oh, fellow men and brothers,</div>
<div class="i2">Could we but use the free</div>
<div class="i0">Advice we give to others,</div>
<div class="i2">How happy we should be!</div>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>
<p>While the title of this book and the character of its contents
make it obvious that it is a volume designed primarily
for the guidance of youth, no one should pass it by merely
because he has reached the years of maturity, and presumably
of discretion. As a matter of fact Time cannot remove
any of us very far from the fancies and foibles, the dreams
and dangers of life&rsquo;s morning hours.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Age bringeth wisdom, so they say,</div>
<div class="i2">But lots of times we&rsquo;ve seen</div>
<div class="i0">A man long after he was gray</div>
<div class="i2">Keep right on being &ldquo;green.&rdquo;</div>

<span class="smaller">THE AWAKENING</span></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Nothing is impossible
to the man who
can will.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Mirabeau.</span></div>

<p>Ho, my brave youth! There&rsquo;s a &ldquo;Boy
Wanted,&rdquo; and&mdash;how fortunate!&mdash;you
are the very boy!</p>

<p>Who wants you?</p>

<div class="sidenote">You will find poetry
nowhere unless you
bring some with you.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Joubert.</span></div>

<p>The big, busy, beautiful world wants
you, and I really do not see how it is
going to get on well without you. It has
awaited your coming so long, and has
kept in store so many golden opportunities
for you to improve, it will be
disappointed if, when the proper time
arrives, you do not smilingly lay hold
and do something worth while.</p>

<p>When are you to begin?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Things don&rsquo;t turn
up in this world until
somebody turns them
up.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Garfield.</span></div>

<p>Oh, I sincerely hope that you have
already begun to begin; that is, that you
have already begun to train your hand
and head and heart for making the most
of the opportunities that await you. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
fact, if you are so fortunate as to own
thoughtful, intelligent parents, the work
of fitting you for the victories of life was
begun before you were old enough to
give the subject serious consideration.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Work has made me
what I am. I never
ate a bit of idle bread
in my life.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Daniel
Webster.</span></div>

<p>&ldquo;When shall I begin to train my
child?&rdquo; asked a young mother of a wise
physician.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How old is the child?&rdquo; inquired the
doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two years.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">In the blackest soils
grow the fairest flowers,
and the loftiest
and strongest trees
spring heavenward
among the rocks.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Holland.</span></div>

<p>&ldquo;Then you have already lost just two
years,&rdquo; was his serious response.</p>

<p>Oliver Wendell Holmes, when asked
the same question, said: &ldquo;You must begin
with the child&rsquo;s grandmother.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Without courage
there cannot be truth;
and without truth
there can be no other
virtue.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Walter
Scott.</span></div>

<p>But no matter what has or has not been
done for you up to the present time, you
and I know that from now on your future
welfare will be largely of your own making
and in your own keeping. If you
will thoughtfully plan your purpose as
definitely as conditions will permit and
then learn to stick to it through thick and
thin, your success in life is quite well
assured, and you need not fear that at the
end of the journey you will have to say,
as does many a man while retrospectively
viewing his years:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Vigilance in watching
opportunity; tact
and daring in seizing
upon opportunity;
force and persistence
in crowding opportunity
to its utmost of
possible achievement&mdash;these
are the martial
virtues which must
command success.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Phelps.</span></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">O&rsquo;er life&rsquo;s long and winding pathway,</div>
<div class="i2">Looking backward, I confess</div>
<div class="i0">I have not at looking forward</div>
<div class="i2">Been a genuine success.</div>
</div></div>

<p>What is there for you to do?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Work is the inevitable
condition of human
life, the true
source of human welfare.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Tolstoi.</span></div>

<p>Everything and anything you can do
or care to do. You are to take your pick
of all the trades, professions, and vocations
of mankind. Look about you and
note the thousand and one things now
being done by the men of to-day. It will
not be so very long till all of these men
will be old enough to retire from active
service, and then you and the other boys,
who in the meantime have grown to
man&rsquo;s estate, will be called upon to perform
every one of the tasks these men are
now doing. Doesn&rsquo;t it look as if there
would be plenty of honest, earnest, wholesome
toil for hand and head in store for
you as soon as you are ready to undertake
it? You cannot wonder that the busy old
world is ever and always hanging out its
notice&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<div class="sidenote">While we are considering
when to begin,
it is often too late
to act.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Quintilian.</span></div>

<p>No, the world does not insist that you
are to accept a position and begin work
with your hands at once, but it wishes you
to begin to think right things. &ldquo;As he
thinketh in his heart, so is he.&rdquo; What
you think will have much to do in determining
what you are to become.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">The mind is master of the man,</div>
<div class="i0">And so &ldquo;they can who think they can.&rdquo;</div>

<div class="sidenote">Where boasting
ends, there dignity begins.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Young.</span></div>

<div class="sidenote">Impossible is a
word found only in
the dictionary of fools.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Napoleon.</span></div>

<p>This influence of the mind in thus
shaping the man is very well set forth by
James Allen, who says: &ldquo;A man&rsquo;s mind
may be likened to a garden, which may
be intelligently cultivated or allowed to
run wild; but whether cultivated or
neglected, it must, and will, bring forth.
If no useful seeds are put into it, then an
abundance of useless weed-seeds will fall
therein, and will continue to produce
their kind. Just as a gardener cultivates
his plot, keeping it free from weeds, and
growing the flowers and fruits which he
requires, so may a man tend the garden
of his mind, weeding out all the wrong,
useless, and impure thoughts, and cultivating
toward perfection the flowers and
fruits of right, useful, and pure thoughts.
By pursuing this process, a man sooner
or later discovers that he is the master-gardener
of his soul, the director of his
life. He also reveals, within himself,
the laws of thought, and understands,
with ever-increasing accuracy, how the
thought-forces and mind-elements operate
in the shaping of his character, circumstances,
and destiny.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">I am in earnest. I
will not equivocate. I
will not excuse. I will
not retreat a single
inch; and I will be
heard.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Garrison.</span></div>

<p>So it is not too early for you to begin
to think bravely and resolutely and hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>fully
upon the life you intend to live, and
to cultivate the mental and physical
strength that shall help you later on to
put your good thoughts into permanent
good deeds. Certainty of victory goes
far toward winning battles before they
are fought. The boy who thinks &ldquo;I can&rdquo;
is much more likely to succeed in life
than is the one who thinks &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="i0">&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t&rdquo; and &ldquo;Could&rdquo; were two promising boys</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">So &ldquo;Could&rdquo; just kept building his way to success,</div>

</div></div>

<div class="sidenote">Weak men wait for
opportunities, strong
men make them.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Marden.</span></div>

<p>By reading between the lines we can
infer from the foregoing that what the
world really wants is men&mdash;good men.
But the world is old enough and wise
enough to know that if it does not train
up some good boys, there will be no good
men, by and by. &ldquo;As the twig is bent the
tree is inclined.&rdquo; &ldquo;The child is father
of the man.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Give me insight
into to-day, and you
may have the antique
and future worlds.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Emerson.</span></div>

<p>So the world simply wishes to inform
you, here and now, that it will count on
your assistance as soon as you have had
sufficient time and opportunity to prepare
properly for the many chances it
has in store for you. It notifies you in
good season of the important use it hopes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
to make of you. It does not wish you to
be confronted suddenly with a life problem
you cannot solve intelligently. You
must be so well equipped that you will
not make life a &ldquo;fizzle.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">When I don&rsquo;t know
whether to fight or
not, I always fight.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Nelson.</span></div>

<p>A &ldquo;fizzle,&rdquo; as defined by the dictionaries,
is a bungling, unsuccessful undertaking.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What is a gentleman?
I&rsquo;ll tell you:
a gentleman is one
who keeps his promises
made to those who
cannot enforce them.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hubbard.</span></div>

<p>Life is, or ought to be, a splendid
undertaking. Some make a success of it;
some make a &ldquo;fizzle;&rdquo; some make a sort
of half-and-half. Every one who lives
his or her life must make something of
it. What that &ldquo;something&rdquo; is depends
very largely on the individual person.
Heredity has something to do with it;
environment has something to do with it;
yet we like to think it is the individual
who has most to do with the finished
product.</p>

<p>All men are to some degree &ldquo;self-made,&rdquo;
although they are slow to admit
it except in instances where the work has
been well done.</p>

<div class="sidenote">When one begins to
turn in bed it is time
to turn out.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Wellington.</span></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">The loser declares it is Fate&rsquo;s hard plan,</div>
<div class="i0">But the winner&mdash;ho, ho!&mdash;he&rsquo;s a &ldquo;self-made&rdquo; man.</div>
</div></div>

<p>It is unfair for the loser to blame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
others for his deficiencies and delinquencies.
No one&rsquo;s reputation is likely
to suffer much lasting injury as long as
he keeps his character unspotted. What
others may say of us is not of so much
moment; the important question is, &ldquo;Is
it true?&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the other hand the winner is
ungrateful when he credits to his own
ability the help and good influence he
has derived from his associates and his
surroundings. No one lives by, to, or for
himself, alone. A great man adds to his
greatness by generously praising those
who have aided in his advancement.</p>

as if you were told to prepare to take
an extended and important journey. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
would require some time for you to procure
a trunk and a traveling-bag and to
select wearing apparel suitable for the
undertaking. Then, too, you would need
to study maps and time-tables so as to
select the best lines of travel and to make
advantageous connections with trains and
steamships. Furthermore, it would be
for your best interests to read books describing
the countries through which you
were to pass, and to learn as much as possible
regarding their peoples and customs.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact you <i>are</i> preparing

journey. You are going out into the big
world, by and by, to do business. You
are going into partnership with the
world, after a fashion. You are to put
into the business your honesty, industry,
integrity, and ability, and in return for
your contributions, the world is to bestow
upon you all the honor, fame, goodwill,

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />
<span class="smaller">&ldquo;AM I A GENIUS?&rdquo;</span></h2>


<div class="sidenote">True merit is like a
river, the deeper it is
the less noise it makes.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Halifax.</span></div>

<p>You hope, and perchance believe, no
doubt, that when you have a full opportunity
to show the world what sort of
timber you are made of that it will look
upon you as being a &ldquo;genius.&rdquo; Almost
every boy cherishes some such aspiration.
And why not? Such a trend of thought
is to be encouraged. It is proper and
commendable. We would all be geniuses
if we could.</p>

<div class="sidenote">We know what we
are, but not what we
may be.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Shakespeare.</span></div>

<p>The world admires a genius. If he is
the genuine article it seeks his autograph,
prints his picture in books and newspapers,
and when he passes away it is
likely to build a monument over his remains.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Vacillation is the
prominent feature of
weakness of character.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Voltaire.</span></div>

<p>And can we all be geniuses? Some
say we can and some say we cannot, quite.
Some say geniuses are born and some say
they are self-made.</p>

<p>When Mr. Edison, the famous electri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>cian
and inventor, was asked for his
definition of genius he answered: &ldquo;Two
per cent is genius and ninety-eight per
cent is hard work.&rdquo; On another occasion
when asked: &ldquo;Mr. Edison, don&rsquo;t you
believe that genius is inspiration?&rdquo; he
replied, &ldquo;No! genius is perspiration.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conduct is three-fourths
of life.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Emerson.</span></div>

<p>This definition of genius quite agrees
with that given by the American statesman,
Alexander Hamilton, who said:
&ldquo;All the genius I have lies in just this:
When I have a subject in hand, I study
it profoundly. Day and night it is before
me. I explore it in all its bearings; my
mind becomes pervaded with it. Then
the effort which I make the people are
pleased to call genius. It is the fruit of
labor and thought.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">We must not yield
to difficulties, but
strive the harder to
overcome them.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Robert
E. Lee.</span></div>

<p>Helvetius, the famous French philosopher,
says: &ldquo;Genius is nothing but a
continued attention,&rdquo; and Buffon tells us
that &ldquo;genius is only a protracted patience.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Through every
clause and part of
speech of a right book,
I meet the eyes of the
most determined men.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Emerson.</span></div>

<p>Turner, the great landscape painter,
when asked how he had achieved his
great success, replied: &ldquo;I have no secret
but hard work. This is a secret that
many never learn, and they do not succeed
because they do not learn it. Labor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
is the genius that changes the world from
ugliness to beauty.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">All your Greek will
never advance you
from secretary to envoy,
or from envoy to
ambassador; but your
address, your air,
your manner, if good,
may.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Chesterfield.</span></div>

<p>&ldquo;The man who succeeds above his fellows,&rdquo;
says Lord Lytton, &ldquo;is the one who
early in life clearly discerns his object
and toward that object habitually directs
his powers. Even genius itself is but fine
observation strengthened by fixity of purpose.
Every man who observes vigilantly
and resolves steadfastly grows unconsciously
into genius.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I a genius?&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">&rsquo;Tis the mind that
makes the body rich.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Shakespeare.</span></div>

<p>Now that you have asked the question,
why not carefully think it over and determine
what the answer should be? Have
you patience and determination? Are
you cultivating the habit of sticking to
it?</p>

<h3>STICK TO IT</h3>

<div class="sidenote">To acquire a few

writer, is the task of
a few years; but to

<p>Genius has a twin brother whose name
is Patience. The one is quite often mistaken
for the other, which is not strange
since they resemble each other so closely
their most intimate friends can scarcely
tell them apart. These two brothers usually
work together, which enables the
world to tell who and what they are, for
whenever either of them is employed
singly and alone he is hardly ever recognized.</p>

<div class="sidenote">To be proud of
learning is the greatest
ignorance.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bishop
Taylor.</span></div>

<p>One of these brothers plants the tree
and the other cares for it until the fruit
is finally matured. The tree which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
Genius plants would never amount to
much if Patience were to grow tired of
watering and caring for it. There are
weeds to be kept down, branches to be
pruned, the soil must be looked after,
worms&rsquo;-nests must be destroyed, and
many things must be done before the
fruit is ready to harvest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Life is not so short
but that there is always
room enough for
courtesy.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Emerson.</span></div>

<p>If Patience were to refuse to work at
any time the whole undertaking would
prove a failure. But he does not. He
performs his plain, simple duty, day after
day, year after year, until, after long
waiting, there is the beautiful fruit at
last. It looks very pretty, but it is not
yet quite ripe. Pick it too soon and it
will shrivel up and lack flavor. But
Patience has learned to wait until the day
and the hour of perfection is at hand,
and lo! there is his great reward!</p>

<div class="sidenote">A man&rsquo;s own good
breeding is the best
security against other
people&rsquo;s ill manners.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Chesterfield.</span></div>

<p>The people say: &ldquo;See this wonderful
fruit that grew on the tree which Genius
planted!&rdquo; But Genius, who is wiser than
the multitude, says, &ldquo;See this wonderful
fruit that grew on the tree which Patience
tended!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Common sense
bows to the inevitable
and makes use of it.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Wendell
Phillips.</span></div>

<p>Patience and perseverance are the
qualities that enable one to work out his
problems in school and his larger prob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>lems
in the big university of the busy

a student, who, disheartened by

his book in despair, when, seeing a

inquired the reason, and was told that
she wanted a needle, and thought she
would rub down the crowbar till she got
it small enough. Provoked by this example
of patience to &ldquo;try again,&rdquo; he
resumed his studies, and became one of
the foremost scholars of the empire.</p>

through the unexplored depths of the
primeval forests of America in the study
of birds and animals, Audubon determined
to publish the results of his painstaking
energy. He went to Philadelphia
with a portfolio of two hundred sheets,
filled with colored delineations of about
one thousand birds, drawn life-size. Being
obliged to leave the city before
making final arrangements as to their disposition,
he placed his drawings in the
warehouse of a friend. On his return in
a few weeks he found to his utter dismay
that the precious fruits of his wanderings
had been utterly destroyed by rats. The
shock threw him into a fever of several
weeks&rsquo; duration, but with returning
health his native energy came back, and
taking up his gun and game-bag, his pencils
and drawing-book, he went forward
to the forests as gaily as if nothing had
happened. He set to work again, pleased
with the thought that he might now make
better drawings than he had done before,
and in three years his portfolio was
refilled.</p>

<p>One of the clever characters created
by the pen of George Horace Lorimer
says: &ldquo;Life isn&rsquo;t a spurt, but a long,

without stopping to sit down. Some men
do a day&rsquo;s work, and then spend six lolling
around admiring it. They rush at a thing
with a whoop and use up all their wind
in that. And when they&rsquo;ve rested and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
got it back, they whoop again and start

<p>The eminent essayist, William Mathews,
tells us: &ldquo;The restless, uneasy, discontented

him, and so he goes wandering about the
world, a half-civilized Arab, getting the

<p>Abraham Lincoln was born of very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
poor parents in a very crude cabin. Some
years later the family passed through a
long, cold, Indiana winter with no shelter
but a shed built of poles, open on one side
to the frosts and snows. Even when a
cabin took the place of this rude &ldquo;camp&rdquo;
it was left several years, we are told, without
floor, doors or windows. His biographers
inform us that here in the primeval
forest Abraham Lincoln spent his boyhood.
His bed of leaves was raised from
the ground by poles, resting upon one side
in the interstices of the logs of which the
hut was built, and upon the other in
crotches of sticks driven into the earth.
The skins of animals afforded almost the
only covering allowed this truly miserable
family. Their food was of the simplest
and coarsest variety and very scarce.
Here Mrs. Lincoln died when Abraham
was nine years old, and her lifeless form
was placed in a rude coffin which Abraham&rsquo;s
father made with his own hands.
The grave was dug in a cleared space in
the forest and there Nancy Hanks Lincoln
was buried. Many months passed
before it was practicable to secure a
preacher who, when he came, gathered
the family about him in the woods and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
spoke a few words over the mound of sod.
When fame had come, Mr. Lincoln used
to say that he never attended school for
more than six months in all his life&mdash;in no
spirit of boastfulness, however, like many
a self-made American, but with a regret
that was deeply felt. While a boy he
worked out his sums on the logs and clapboards
of the little cabin, evincing the
fondness for mathematics that remained
with him through life. But even amid
his dark isolation some light found its
way to his slowly expanding mind. He
got hold of a copy of &ldquo;Aesop&rsquo;s Fables,&rdquo;
read &ldquo;Robinson Crusoe&rdquo; and borrowed
Weems&rsquo;s &ldquo;Life of Washington,&rdquo; filling
his mind with the story of that noble
character. One night after he had
climbed up the pegs, which served as a
ladder to reach his cot, which in the more
finished condition of the cabin had been
placed in the attic, he hid the book under
the rafters. The rain which came in before
morning soaked the leaves so that he
was compelled to go to the farmer from
whom he had borrowed the book and
offer to make good the loss. That unphilanthropic
neighbor exacted as its
price three days&rsquo; work in the corn-field,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
and at the end of that time the damaged
volume came into the youthful Abraham&rsquo;s
absolute possession. It was a long way
from those rude surroundings to the
presidential chair in the White House at
Washington, but &ldquo;with malice toward
none, with charity for all, with firmness
in the right, as God gives us to see the
right,&rdquo; he made the journey to the glory
of himself and the American people.</p>

<p>When Thomas A. Edison went out into
the world to make his way, he had
received only two months&rsquo; regular schooling,
but his mother had early impressed
upon his mind the thought that he must
atone for his lack of school training by
developing a taste for reading. His biographers
tell us that the &ldquo;Penny Encyclopedia&rdquo;
and Ure&rsquo;s &ldquo;History of the Sciences&rdquo;
were in his hands at a time when
most boys, having become acquainted
with stories of adventure, look for mystery
in every bush and resolve to become
pirates and Indian fighters. There are
many stories of his early acuteness. One
relates how when a boy of twelve or
fourteen he was employed in selling
papers on a railroad train in Michigan,
and upon receiving advance news of a
battle of the Rebellion fought at that time
he secured fifteen hundred papers on
credit, telegraphed the headlines to the
stations along the route, and sold his wares
at a premium. It was after this exploit
that he conceived the idea of starting a
daily paper of his own. Securing some
old type from the &ldquo;Detroit Free Press,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
he set up his establishment in a car and
began the publication of the &ldquo;Grand
Trunk Herald,&rdquo; the first newspaper ever
published on a train. He also installed
in the car a laboratory for making experiments
in chemistry, and both his newspaper
and his experiments flourished
until one unlucky day when he set fire to
the car with phosphorus. This was too
much for the conductor who promptly
threw the young editor and scientist
with all his belongings out on the station
platform, and in addition boxed his ears
so roughly as to cause him to be ever
after partly deaf. But misfortune could
not dampen his ardor. His lack of
schooling was more than atoned for by
his grit, ambition and studious habits.
With the possession of these qualities
and the disposition to make the most
of spare moments, this famous physicist,
chemist, mechanician, and inventor has
done more for himself, and more for
humanity and the advancement of civilization
than any of the college-bred workers
in industrial sciences during the last
half-century.</p>

<p>Thousands of other examples might
be mentioned to show that lowly birth is
no barrier to lofty attainment. It has
been truly said that genius ignores all
social barriers and springs forth wherever
heaven has dropped the seed. The grandest
characters known in art, literature,
and the useful inventions, have illustrated
the axiom that &ldquo;brave deeds are the ancestors
of brave men,&rdquo; and, as Ballou has
told us, &ldquo;it would almost appear that an
element of hardship is necessary to the
effective development of true genius. Indeed,
when we come to the highest
achievements of the greatest minds, it

<p>&ldquo;Those unhappy children who are

Professor Huxley. &ldquo;The keenness and
vitality which should have been stored

have been washed out of them by
precocious mental debauchery, by book-gluttony

Two boys were once members of
a class in the Edinburgh Grammar

a dolt. In due time John became Baillie

<p>We all know that there is a happy

and slovenliness; between laziness and
an unwarranted degree of mental activity;
between ignorance and an intellect
ground to an edge too fine to carve its
way through a hard world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is now generally conceded on all
hands,&rdquo; says Professor Mathews, &ldquo;that
the mind has no right to build itself up at
the expense of the body; that it is no more
justifiable in abandoning itself without
restraint to its cravings, than the body in
yielding itself to sensual indulgence. The
acute stimulants, the mental drams, that
produce this unnatural activity or overgrowth
of the intellect, are as contrary to
nature, and as hurtful to the man, as the
coarser stimulants that unduly excite the
body. The mind, it has been well said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
should be a good, strong, healthy feeder,
but not a glutton. When unduly stimulated,
it wears out the mechanism of the
body, like friction upon a machine not
lubricated, and the growing weakness of
the physical frame nullifies the power
it incloses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Is it to be a good, firm, durable foundation
that will stand through all the
years to come? Or is it being built of
faulty material and in a manner so careless
that in the by and by when, at great
pains and expense you have built your
life structure upon it, you will find it
untenable or so unstable that it will require
a great share of your time and attention
to keep it patched up so that you can
continue to dwell within it?</p>

<p>Are you playing and working with

<p>A sorry picture, isn&rsquo;t it? No doubt it
sets forth, in an extreme manner, the evils
that arise from crowding a child into
boyhood, and a boy into manhood; still,
no one who observes carefully will doubt
that such wrongs are constantly being
committed by hundreds of ambitious
parents and well-meaning teachers.</p>

of a man is to be
born with a bias to
some pursuit, which

<p>Yet, I think you have little to fear along
the lines of over-study. You must train
your mind to grapple with tasks while
you are young, for if you do not begin
now you may not, later on, be able to
summon that concentration of thought
that is necessary for winning success
along any line of endeavor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Difficulties are the best stimulant.

<p>Sharpen your wits as the woodman

The woodman who would stay

would be deemed very foolish.</p>

<p>Of course you will be, you must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
thoughtful, for as Ruskin says: &ldquo;In general
I have no patience with people who
talk about &lsquo;the thoughtlessness of youth&rsquo;
indulgently. I had infinitely rather hear
of the thoughtlessness of old age, and the
indulgence of that. When a man has
done his work, and nothing can in any
way be materially altered in his fate, let
him forget his toil, and jest with his fate,
if he will, but what excuse can you find
for wilfulness of thought at the very time
when every crisis of fortune hangs on
your decision? A youth thoughtless,
when all the happiness of his home
forever depends on the chances or the
passions of an hour! A youth thoughtless,
when the career of all his days depends
on the opportunity of a moment!
A youth thoughtless, when his every action
is a foundation-stone of future conduct,
and every imagination a fountain
of life or death! Be thoughtless in any
after years, rather than now, though,
indeed, there is only one place where a
man may be nobly thoughtless, his death-bed.
Nothing should ever be left to be
done there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But whatever else we may forget, let
us remember that it is not work, but over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>work
that kills. Exercise gained through
good, wholesome work is the greatest life-preserver
man has yet discovered.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The great hope of
society is in the individual
character.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Channing.</span></div>

<p>&ldquo;I always find something to keep me
busy,&rdquo; said Peter Cooper in explaining
how he had preserved so well his strength

<div class="sidenote">No thoroughly occupied
man was ever

<p>The ones who live the longest and best

<p>&ldquo;If I had the time!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yes, indeed! Time is a very necessary
factor in the doing of things. Time
is money. Money is capital. Capital is
power. The one who is in the possession
of the most power and uses it to the best
purpose has the best chance for winning
success.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The greatest work

<p>Other things being equal, the boy who

<div class="sidenote">The greatest men

<p>That is the sorry cry coming from the
lips of thousands of unhappy persons of
all classes and ages. But the saddest
feature of it all is, that they have the time

<p>We should play with the same keen

<p>It is an error to think that play cannot

<p>Channing tells us, &ldquo;it is astonishing
how fruitful of improvement a short season
becomes when eagerly and faithfully
improved. Volumes have not only been
read, but written, in flying journeys. I
have known a man of vigorous intellect,
who has enjoyed few advantages of early
education, and whose mind was almost
engrossed by the details of an extensive
business, but who composed a book of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
much original thought, in steamboats

<p>The thought recorded by Jeremy Taylor
is well worth remembering, that he
who is choice of his time will also
be choice of his company, and choice of
his actions; lest the first engage him in
vanity and loss, and the latter, by being
criminal, be throwing his time and himself
away, and going back in the accounts
of eternity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, what wonders have been performed
in &lsquo;one hour a day,&rsquo;&rdquo; says Marden.
&ldquo;One hour a day withdrawn from
frivolous pursuits, and profitably employed,
would enable any man of ordinary
capacity to master a complete
science. One hour a day would make an
ignorant man a well-informed man in
ten years. One hour a day would earn
enough to pay for two daily and two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
weekly papers, two leading magazines,
and a dozen good books. In an hour
a day a boy or girl could read
twenty pages thoughtfully&mdash;over seven
thousand pages, or eighteen large volumes,
in a year. An hour a day might
make all the difference between bare
existence and useful, happy living. An
hour a day might make&mdash;nay, has made&mdash;an
unknown man a famous one, a useless
man a benefactor to his race. Consider,
then, the mighty possibilities of
two&mdash;four&mdash;yes, six hours a day that
are, on the average, thrown away by
young men and women in the restless
desire for fun and diversion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is little excuse for continued
ignorance these times. If one&rsquo;s time is
spent at a point remote from institutions
of learning, or his days are so occupied
that he cannot avail himself of their advantages,
he can be a pupil in an ably
conducted correspondence school, that
most worthy of educational means
whereby the youth in the isolated rural
home, the shut-ins who by force of circumstances
are prisoned within narrow
walls, the night-watchman whose leisure
comes at a time when all other schools<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
are closed, the seeker after knowledge of
any kind, at any time and at any place
reached by the great governmental postal
system, can be brought into close
touch with a great fountain of learning
and inspiration of which one may absorb
all he will. From this time forth it will
ill become any man to say that he has no
chance to acquire an education, or that
he has no opportunity to improve upon
the mental equipment he already possesses.
Instruction is within the reach of
all. The schoolmaster is abroad as he
has never been before. Wherever the
postman can deliver a letter, in cottage
or mansion, in the closely packed tenements
of the city or in the remote farm
homes reached by the rural free delivery
routes, there the trained college professor
makes his daily or weekly visits,
giving his &ldquo;heart to heart&rdquo; talks with
each of his thousands of pupils. He is
with the boys as they follow the plow,
the men who go down into the mines, the
girls who serve at the loom and the lathe,
pointing out the way that leads, through
self-help, to happiness.</p>

The means are more nearly at hand if
one is determined to try them. Nothing
but the spirit of procrastination can keep
man or boy from setting about it to help
himself toward better things. When to
begin is the stumbling-block in the way
of most persons. There is but one time
when we can do anything. That time is
NOW! To delay a year, a week, a day
may prove most unfortunate. Indeed,
trouble lies in the way of those who are
disposed to defer the doing of their duty

<p>If we make a careful study of the lives
of the world&rsquo;s great men and women,
we shall find that their distinction was
achieved by making the most of their
spare minutes. The ordinary, commonplace,
and inevitable tasks of life and the
effort required to make a living are remarkably
similar in the daily experience
of most men and women. It is what one
does with the remaining leisure moments
that determines his individual taste and
trend, and eventually gives him such distinction
as he may attain. It is in our
leisure hours that we are permitted to
follow our &ldquo;hobbies,&rdquo; and it is in them
that our truer selves find expression.
Many of the greatest men in the world&rsquo;s
history achieved their fame outside of
their regular occupations in the spare
moments of time which most people
think are of no serious use. Marden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
wisely observes that &ldquo;no one is anxious
about a young man while he is busy in
useful work. But where does he eat his
lunch at noon? Where does he go when
he leaves his boarding-house at night?
What does he do after supper? Where
does he spend his Sundays and holidays?
The great majority of youth who go to
the bad are ruined after supper. Most
of them who climb upward to honor and
fame devote their evenings to study or
work or the society of the wise and good.
For the right use of these leisure hours,
what we have called the waste of life,
the odd moments usually thrown away,
the author would plead with every
youth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Watt learned chemistry and mathematics
while working at his trade of a
mathematical-instrument maker. Darwin
composed most of his works by
writing his thoughts on scraps of paper
wherever he chanced to be. Henry
Kirke White learned Greek while walking
to and from a lawyer&rsquo;s office. Elihu
Burritt acquired a mastery of eighteen
languages and twenty-two dialects by improving
the fragments of time which he
could steal from his occupation as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
blacksmith. Hundreds of similar examples
could be given in which men
have achieved distinction by improving
the odd moments which others waste.</p>

into a beautiful purpose that shall make
your life a joy to yourself and to all who
shall come within the zone of your influence.
Do not fail to improve the moments
because they are so few. The
fewer there are the more the need of improving
them. Do not procrastinate, do
not put off, do not defer the work of self-improvement
till a more favorable time.
Know that with the coming of every
opportunity you have a duty to perform.

<p>&ldquo;As you cannot have a sweet and

says James Allen, &ldquo;so a strong body and
a bright, happy, or serene countenance
can result only from the free admittance
into the mind of thoughts of joy and
good will and serenity. There is no physician
like cheerful thought for dissipating
the ills of the body; there is no comforter
to compare with good will for dispersing
the shadows of grief and sorrow.
To live continually in thoughts of ill
will, cynicism, suspicion and envy, is to
be confined in a self-made prison-hole.
But to think well of all, to be cheerful
with all, to patiently learn to find the
good in all&mdash;such unselfish thoughts are
the very portals of heaven; and to dwell
day by day in thoughts of peace toward
every creature will bring abounding
peace to the possessor of such thoughts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give, O give us, the man who sings
at his work!&rdquo; says Thomas Carlyle. &ldquo;Be
his occupation what it may, he is equal to
any of those who follow the same pursuit
in silent sullenness. He will do more
in the same time&mdash;he will do it better&mdash;he
will persevere longer. One is scarcely
sensible to fatigue while he marches to
music. The very stars are said to make
harmony as they revolve in their spheres.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
Wondrous is the strength of cheerfulness,
altogether past calculation its powers of
endurance. Efforts to be permanently
useful must be uniformly joyous&mdash;a spirit
all sunshine&mdash;grateful for very gladness,
beautiful because bright.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Have you a cheerful member in your
circle of friends, a cheerful neighbor in
the vicinity of your home? Cherish him
as a pearl of great price. He is of real,
practical value to all with whom he comes
in contact. His presence in a neighborhood
ought to make real estate sell for
a bit more a square foot, and life more
prized by all who partake of his good
cheer. He greets the world with a smile
and a laugh&mdash;a real laugh, born of
thought and feeling&mdash;not a superficial
veneer of humor the falsity of which is
detected by all who hear it. &ldquo;How much
lies in laughter,&rdquo; says Carlyle &ldquo;It is the
cipher-key wherewith we decipher the
whole man. Some men wear an everlasting
simper; in the smile of another
lies the cold glitter, as of ice; the fewest
are able to laugh what can be called
laughing, but only sniff and titter and
snicker from the throat outward, or at
least produce some whiffing, husky cach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>ination,

wool. Of none such comes good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Do you like the boy who in a game of

<p>Isn&rsquo;t the real manly boy the one who

<div class="sidenote">It is easy finding
reasons why other
folks should be patient.&mdash;<span class="smcap">George
Eliot.</span></div>

<p>The one who thinks the world is full
of good people and kindly blessings is
much richer than the one who thinks to
the contrary. Some men live in a world
peopled with princes of the royal blood;
some in a world of want and wrong-doers.
Those whom we distrust are likely to distrust
us. To believe a man is a man helps
to make him so at heart. To think him a
rascal is a start for him in the wrong
direction. The world smiles at us if we
smile at it; when we frown it frowns. It
is the armor of war and not that of love
that invites trouble. He who carries a
sword is the most likely to find a cause
for using it. The man who remembers
it was a beautiful day yesterday is a great
deal happier than he who is sure it is
going to storm to-morrow.</p>

to take things by the smooth handles saves
himself and those about him an endless

additional sorrow in a world that holds

some shreds of song. It was of one such
sorry soul that I penned the lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Be at war with
your vices, at peace

along in years who has not yet acquired
sufficient wisdom to understand that without
some of the elements of a storm in the

<div class="sidenote">Give us to go

<p>Without hunger and thirst, food and
drink would be superfluous; without
cold, warmth would lose its grateful
charm; without weariness, rest were of
no avail; without grief, gladness would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>

<p>&ldquo;Of all virtues cheerfulness is the most
profitable. While other virtues defer
the day of recompense, cheerfulness pays
down. It is a cosmetic which makes
homeliness graceful and winning. It

vigor to the mind; it is the bright weather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
of the heart in contrast with the clouds
and gloom of melancholy.&rdquo; These words
from the writings of one of our sunniest

one who will ever keep them in mind.</p>

<p>Sydney Smith says that &ldquo;all mankind
are happier for having been happy; so
that, if you make them happy now, you
make them happy twenty years hence by
the memory of it.&rdquo; This being true we

from gloom to gladness; from the shadows
to sunshine. With this purpose in

<p>&ldquo;Hitch your wagon to a star!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Such is the advice Emerson gave
to ambitious youth. He meant well, no
doubt, and indeed, his words are all right
if taken with a pinch of salt. A boy
should dream great dreams, of course,
but he ought to set his dream-gauge so as
to have it indicate a line of endeavor it
will be possible for him to follow.</p>

<p>The type of boy the world counts on to
do it the most lasting good is the youth
that does not permit the wings of fancy
to carry him so far into the blue empyrean
that he cannot touch the solid earth with
at least the tiptoes of reason.</p>

<p>As Wingate truly says: &ldquo;There is no
use in filling young people&rsquo;s minds with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
vain hopes; not every one can make a

The peach

<p>When the time arrives for a boy to
cease dreaming and to begin doing he
should seize upon the highest duty that
comes to his hands and waste not a moment

beyond your most sanguine dreams.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hopes are good, but patiently worked-out
realities are better. Hope is for
to-morrow. Work is for to-day. The
hope that lulls one into a dreamy inactivity,
with the promise that all will be
well, whether or no, is sometimes a hin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>drance

<div class="i4">Hope&rsquo;s a magical compound</div>
<div class="i4">To increase our strength, we&rsquo;ve found,</div>

design for a mansion, on paper, cannot

<p>But it is to be remembered that the
youth who does not think well of himself
is not likely to do well. &ldquo;Ability, learning,
accomplishment, opportunity, are
all well,&rdquo; says Mathews, &ldquo;but they do
not, of themselves, insure success. Thousands
have all these, and live and die
without benefiting themselves or others.
On the other hand, men of mediocre talents,
often scale the dizzy steeps of excellence
and fame because they have firm
faith and high resolve. It is this solid
faith in one&rsquo;s mission&mdash;the rooted belief
that it is the one thing to which he has
been called,&mdash;this enthusiasm, attracting
an Agassiz to the Alps or the Amazon,
impelling a Pliny to explore the volcano
in which he is to lose his life, and nerv<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>ing

<p>When we come to observe life very
closely we learn that the law of recompense
is always in operation, and that
when all things are considered, one man&rsquo;s
lot does not seem so much better or another&rsquo;s
so much worse than the fortune
of those about him as a superficial glance
might lead us to think. Says Hamerton:
&ldquo;I used to believe a great deal more
in opportunities and less in application
than I do now. Time and health are
needed, but with these there are always
opportunities. Rich people have a fancy
for spending money very uselessly on
their culture because it seems to them
more valuable when it has been costly;
but the truth is, that by the blessing of
good and cheap literature, intellectual
light has become almost as accessible as
daylight. I have a rich friend who
travels more, and buys more costly things
than I do, but he does not really learn
more or advance farther in the twelvemonth.
If my days are fully occupied,
what has he to set against them? only
other well-occupied days, no more. If
he is getting benefit at St. Petersburg he
is missing the benefit I am getting round
my house, and in it. The sum of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
year&rsquo;s benefit seems to be surprisingly
alike in both cases. So if you are reading
a piece of thoroughly good literature,
Baron Rothschild may possibly be as
well occupied as you&mdash;he is certainly not
better occupied. When I open a noble
volume I say to myself, &lsquo;Now the only
Croesus that I envy is he who is reading
a better book than this.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is many a boy who is quite sure
the neighbor&rsquo;s boy has an easier time and
a better prospect of success. Grown-ups,
too, are frequently of the opinion that
they could do so much better if they were
in somebody else&rsquo;s shoes. Between the
success which others attain and that
which we achieve, we can very readily
distinguish</p>

<h3>THE DIFFERENCE</h3>

<div class="i0">When the other fellow gets rich it&rsquo;s luck,</div>
<div class="i2">Just blundering luck that brings him gains,</div>

<p>The country boy is sure that if he
could get into the large city where there
are more and greater chances for doing
things he would make a great success.
The city boy is quite as certain that if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
could get out into a country town where
the competition is not so fierce and where
there is more room to grow he would do
something worth while. In discussing
this subject, Edward Bok says: &ldquo;It is the
man, not the place that counts. The
magnet of worth is the drawing power in
business. It is what you are, not where
you are. If a young man has the right
stuff in him, he need not fear where he
lives or does his business. Many a large
man has expanded in a small place. The
idea that a small place retards a man&rsquo;s
progress is pure nonsense. If the community
does not offer facilities for a
growing business, they can be brought to
it. Proper force can do anything. All
that is needed is right direction. The
vast majority of people are like sheep,
they follow a leader.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="i0">I find it&rsquo;s jest as short and thin as all the rest, or wuss;</div>

<span class="smaller">&ldquo;TRIFLES&rdquo;</span></h2>


<div class="sidenote">It is ours to climb
and dare.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Frederick
Lawrence Knowles.</span></div>

<p>&ldquo;Trifles make perfection, but perfection
is no trifle.&rdquo; The saying
is old but the truth is ever new.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Oh, sweet is life
when youth is in the
blood.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Denis McCarthy.</span></div>

<p>It is the little things that count, day by
day, in the forming of character. The
way in which we employ our moments
finally becomes the way in which we employ
our years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Down in the busy
thoroughfares are boys
the world shall know
some day.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Samuel
Ellsworth Kiser.</span></div>

<p>As a matter of course every boy will, if
he can, do some big, beautiful thing out
there in the years to come. But it is a
foregone conclusion that every boy must
do a vast number of little things before he
shall do the larger things. The &ldquo;trifles&rdquo;
are always at hand waiting to be done,
day after day, year after year. And it is
the way in which a boy does these little
things that gives him the standing he
holds in the estimation of those with
whom he is intimately associated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As the twig is bent, the tree&rsquo;s in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>clined.&rdquo;
A habit is easy to form but hard
to break. Yet the strongest of habits are
formed just a little at a time&mdash;a small
strand is added each day until there is a
mighty cable that cannot be broken except
by a mighty effort. If it is a good habit,
its strength makes it all the better! If it
is a bad habit, its strength makes it so
much the worse.</p>

<div class="sidenote">To him who presses
on, at each degree new
visions rise.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Julia
Ward Howe.</span></div>

<div class="sidenote">To doubt is failure,
and to dare, success.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Frederick
Lawrence Knowles.</span></div>

<div class="sidenote">It&rsquo;s nothing against
you to fall down flat,
but to lie there is disgrace.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Edmund
Vance Cooke.</span></div>

<p>Where is the boy who cannot see the
fallacy in such illogical reasoning as this:
&ldquo;Now, I will be careless while I am
young so that I may be careful when I am
older. I will remain ignorant and poorly
informed while I am a boy, so that I may
be wise when I am a man. I will bend
one way while I am a twig so that I shall
incline in another direction when I become
a tree. I will do wrong things while
my character is being formed so that I
may do right things when my habits become
fixed.&rdquo; All such reasoning is very,
very foolish, isn&rsquo;t it? And yet there are
some illogical youths who deem it will be
easy to have one character and disposition
as boys and quite a different one when
they come to be men. By some strange
hocus-pocus they hope to be able to sow
a crop of &ldquo;wild oats&rdquo; and later on reap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
a harvest of good wheat. It cannot be
done.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Do it right now and
do it well.&mdash;<span class="smcap">John
Townsend Trowbridge.</span></div>

<p>Any farmer&rsquo;s boy will tell you that &ldquo;as
ye sow, so shall ye reap.&rdquo; When the
farmer wishes to harvest wheat he does
not sow oats. When he wishes a crop of
potatoes he does not plant gourds. He
has learned that what he plants in the
spring he will harvest in the autumn. It
is equally as true of life. That which
we sow in youth we reap in our maturer
years. We must not try to deceive nature
and our own consciences. We shall
get back from the years what we give to
the years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Condemn no creed!
Dig deep beneath the
sod and at the root
thou&rsquo;lt find the truth
of God.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Alicia K.
Van Buren.</span></div>

<p>The boy who early gets into the habit
of doing things right is pretty sure to go
on doing them so all his life, and without
much effort on his part. The will
is strengthened by exercise in the same
manner as are the muscles. We learn to
do easily that which we do often.</p>

<div class="sidenote">It is adversity, not
prosperity, which
breeds men; as it is the
storm, and not the
calm, which makes the
mariner.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Melvin L.

<div class="sidenote">The slow long way
may be the best.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Nathan
Haskell

<div class="sidenote">He who lifts his
brother man in turn is
lifted by him.&mdash;<span class="smcap">John

<div class="sidenote">As the twig is archetypal
of the tree, so
childhood builds the
ladder up which manhood
climbs.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Melvin
L. Severy.</span></div>

<p>The youth who says &ldquo;No&rdquo; to little
temptations will, later on in life, be perfectly
able to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to temptations
of any size. And how many a man&rsquo;s
career has been made glorious simply
because he learned, while a youth, to
say &ldquo;No&rdquo; whenever his moral conscience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
told him it was the thing he should
say! How true are the teachings of the
wise moralist who tells us: &ldquo;A very little
word is &lsquo;No.&rsquo; It is composed of but
two letters and forms only one syllable.
In meaning it is so definite as to defy
misunderstanding. Your lips find its
articulation easy. Diminutive in size,
evident in import, easy of utterance, frequent
in use, and necessary in ordinary
speech, it seems one of the simplest and
most harmless of all words. Yet there
are those to whom it is almost a terror.
Its sound makes them afraid. They
would expurgate it from their vocabulary
if they could. The little monosyllable
sticks in their throat. Their pliable and
easy temper inclines them to conformity,
and frequently works their bane. Assailed
by the solicitations of pleasure
they are sure to yield, for at once and
resolutely they will not repeat &lsquo;No!&rsquo;
Plied with the intoxicating cup they seldom
overcome, for their facile nature
refuses to express itself in &lsquo;No!&rsquo; Encountering
temptation in the hard and
duteous path they are likely to falter and
fall, for they have not the boldness to
speak out the decided negative &lsquo;No!&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
Amid the mists of time, and involved in
the labyrinthine mazes of error, they are
liable to forget eternal verities and join
in the ribald jest, for they have not been
accustomed to utter an emphatic &lsquo;No!&rsquo;
All the noble souls and heroes of history
have held themselves ready, whenever it
was demanded, to say &lsquo;No!&rsquo; The poet
said &lsquo;No!&rsquo; to the sloth and indolence
which was consuming his precious hours,
and wove for himself in heavenly song a
garland of immortality.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">All that we send
into the lives of others
comes back into our
own.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Edwin Markham.</span></div>

<div class="sidenote">The greatest, strongest,
most skilled is he
who knows how to
wait, and wait patiently.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Charles
the Ninth.</span></div>

<p>&ldquo;No&rdquo; might seem to be but a mere
trifle of a word yet the boy who learns to
say it on every right occasion has already
conquered many of the foes that are
likely to beset him along life&rsquo;s pathway.
Every boy should cultivate his will until
it is strong enough for him to depend
upon it at all times. With the proper
amount of will he is sure to have sufficient
&ldquo;won&rsquo;t&rdquo; to resist all the temptations
that wrong may offer him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The man in whom
others believe is a
power, but if he believes
in himself he is
doubly powerful.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Willis
George Emerson.</span></div>

<p>In developing a strength that enables
him to say &ldquo;No!&rdquo; to wrong things a boy
becomes strong enough to say &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; to
right things. His &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; with which
he meets wrong suggestions engenders
his &ldquo;I will!&rdquo; toward the wholesome and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
commendable undertakings in which he
should be interested.</p>

<div class="sidenote">One forgives everything
in him who forgives
himself nothing.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Chinese.</span></div>

<p>When a boy has learned to say, and
to feel the strength that is in the words,
&ldquo;I will!&rdquo; he ceases to make use of the
words, &ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; for his will is sufficient
to make his wish a living reality. And
what a world of difference there is between
the involved meanings of the
words,</p>

<p>It was just a trifling incident that developed
one of the greatest vocalists the
world has ever known. We are told that
Jenny Lind, at the beginning of her life,
was a poor, neglected little girl, homely
and uncouth, living in a single room of
a tumble-down house in a narrow street
at Stockholm. When the humble woman
who had her in charge went out to her
daily labor, she was accustomed to lock
Jenny in with her sole companion, a cat.
One day the little girl, who was always
singing to herself like a canary-bird,
&ldquo;because,&rdquo; as she said, &ldquo;the song was in
her and must come out,&rdquo; sat with her
dumb companion at the window warbling
her sweet child-like notes. She was
overheard by a passing lady, who paused
and listened, struck by the trill and clearness
of the untutored notes. She made
careful inquiry about the child and became
the patroness of the little Jenny who
was at once supplied with a music-teacher.
She loved the art of song, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
having a true genius for it she made
rapid progress, surprising both patroness
and teachers, and presently, became the
world&rsquo;s &ldquo;Queen of Song.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">A teacher who can

<p>How trifling was the incident that
brought about, by a happy accident, the
development of the genius which slept in
the soul of the sculptor Canova! A superb
banquet was being prepared in the
palace of the Falieri family in Venice.
The tables were already arranged, when
it was discovered that a crowning ornament
of some sort was required to complete
the general effect of the banqueting
board. Canova&rsquo;s grandfather, who
brought him up, was a stone-cutter, often
hewing out stone ornaments for architects;
and as he lived close at hand, he
was hastily consulted by the steward of
the Falieris. Canova chanced to go with
his grandfather to view the tables, and
overheard the conversation. Though but
a child his quick eye and ready genius
at once suggested a suitable design for
the apex of the principal dishes. &ldquo;Give
me a plate of cold butter,&rdquo; said the boy;
and seating himself at a side table he
rapidly moulded a lion of proper proportions,
and so true to nature in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
pose and detail as to astonish all present.
It was put in place and proved to be the
most striking ornamental feature of the
feast. When the guests, on being seated,
discovered the lion, they exclaimed aloud
with admiration, and demanded to see
at once the person who could perform
such a miracle impromptu. Canova was
brought before them, and his boyish person
only heightened their wonder. From
that hour the head of the opulent Falieri
family became his kind, appreciative,
liberal patron. Canova was placed under
the care of the best sculptors of Venice
and Rome and became a grand master
of his art.</p>

<p>But it may be truthfully said that
every boy does not possess some latent
genius, waiting to be discovered by some
one who will foster and develop it.
Then there is all the more need of making
the very most of the small talents
one may possess. One need not be a
Canova, or a Shakespeare, in order that
he may become something worth while
to those with whom he dwells in close
association.</p>

<p>Do not wait for some big event out

here and now, by seizing upon the
&ldquo;trifles&rdquo; that lie all about you. The
great wall of solid masonry is not put

and carefully, brick by brick. So manhood
must be built a &ldquo;trifle&rdquo; at a time
until a character is established that temptation
cannot totter to the earth.</p>

shall make the most of them, larger opportunities
will be vouchsafed him. The
one important consideration is whether
he is ready to begin to build at the present
moment, and to utilize the splendid
&ldquo;trifles&rdquo; all about him, or will procrastinate
till such time as he can by some
great sweep of action, establish his reputation

<span class="smaller">THE WORTH OF ADVICE</span></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Courage is a virtue
that the young cannot
spare; to lose it is to
grow old before the
time; it is better to
make a thousand mistakes
and suffer a thousand
reverses than to
run away from the battle.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Henry
Van
Dyke.</span></div>

<p>Of what value is this book to you?</p>

<p>Perhaps there is more involved in
the answer to this question than a careless
consideration of it might lead one to
think. Shakespeare says: &ldquo;A jest&rsquo;s prosperity
lies in the ear of him that hears it,
never in the tongue of him that makes
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So it is that the value of advice depends
not so much upon the giver as it
does upon the one who receives it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">He needs no other
rosary whose thread
of life is strung with
beads of love and
thought.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Persian.</span></div>

<p>Emerson has observed that he who
makes a tour of Europe brings home
from that country only as much as he
takes there with him. This same truth
holds good in the reading of books and
in listening to sermons and lectures. He
that has not eyes with which to see, will
see nothing. He that has not ears with
which to hear, can hear nothing.</p>

<p>A sign-post indicating which road to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
take to reach a certain destination surely
ought to be of great value to a traveler
in a strange land. If the traveler, having
failed to cultivate the habit of observing
his surroundings, passes by the
sign-post without seeing it, or if he reads
its directions and says to himself: &ldquo;I
think I know better; I shall reach my
destination by whatever road I choose
to travel,&rdquo; then the sign-post is of no true
use to him. Not that it is not a good
sign-post. No, the sign-post is all right;
it is the traveler who is wrong. He must
go his own way and, perhaps, journey
far, and fare sadly before he arrives at
the place he seeks&mdash;the destination he
might have reached pleasantly and in
good season. Franklin tells us that experience
is a dear teacher but fools will
learn from no other.</p>

<p>Now this book which you hold in
your hand is only a guide-post, or perhaps
we had better call it a guide-book.
It is intended for the use of the boys of
our land and all other persons who are
not too old or too wise to learn more.</p>

<div class="sidenote">It is not erudition

<p>Every boy is starting out on a long,
interesting, and tremendously important
journey. It will lie mostly through a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
strange country and is a journey which
must, in a very large sense, be traveled
alone by each individual person. There
are many partings of the ways; many
perplexing forks in the road.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Give what you have.
To some one it may
be better than you
dare to think.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Longfellow.</span></div>

<p>The thoughtful boy will ever feel
called upon to ask his highest understanding:
&ldquo;Which is the right road for
me to take?&rdquo; He will not carelessly pass
by the sign-posts without learning what
they have to tell him, nor will he forget
or refuse to be guided by their instructions
and admonitions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">There are men who
complain that roses
have thorns. They
should be grateful to
know that thorns have
roses.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Max O&rsquo;Rell.</span></div>

<p>If a sign post says: &ldquo;Danger! Go
Slowly!&rdquo; he will govern his movements
accordingly. If the sign-post says: &ldquo;Railroad
Crossing. Beware of the Engine!&rdquo;
he will not blindly plunge ahead without
waiting to see if his course is clear.
He will understand that many others
have traveled the way before him and
have learned by experience that it is well
for all to take heed and do as the sign-post
directs.</p>

<p>This life-long pathway upon which
every boy is starting is a winding, intricate,
interesting way, and many there are
who turn into the wrong roads that are
ever leading off from the main-traveled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
track. It is the purpose of this volume
to serve as a guide-book for the boy who
desires to reach Happiness and Helpfulness,
Prosperity and Splendid Manhood
in the most direct and efficient manner.
At every turn of life&rsquo;s way it will warn
him from the blind paths that would
bring him, by the way of Idleness, Carelessness,
Ignorance, and Extravagance, to
the unfortunate land of Failure, of
Broken Hopes, and of Life Misspent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A word spoken in due season, how
good is it!&rdquo; In these pages over which
your eye is passing are spoken the words
of a large and distinguished company of
the world&rsquo;s best and wisest men and women.
Emerson says: &ldquo;Every book is a
quotation; every house is a quotation out

and every man is a quotation from
all his ancestors.&rdquo;</p>

teachers are the people,
books, animals, plants,
stones, and earth round

<p>&ldquo;In the multitude of counsellors there
is safety.&rdquo; The value of well-selected
quotations to serve as finger-posts to
guide us day by day is thus set forth by
the great German poet, Goethe: &ldquo;Whatever
may be said against such collections
which present authors in a disjointed
form they nevertheless bring about many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
excellent results. We are not always so
composed, so full of wisdom, that we
are able to take in at once the whole
scope of a work according to its merits.
Do we not mark in a book passages
which seem to have a direct reference
to ourselves? Young people especially,
who have failed in acquiring a complete
cultivation of the mind, are roused in a
praiseworthy way by brilliant quotations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And if it shall so happen that some
word or sentence or sentiment contained
in this book shall rouse in a praiseworthy
way just one boy&mdash;the very boy whose
thought is dwelling on these lines at this
very moment&mdash;all of this labor of love
shall have been abundantly rewarded.
For just one boy roused to his best efforts
can grandly gladden his own home circle
and, perchance, the whole wide world.</p>

<p>Of the multitudes of boys who are to

best who earliest in life learns carefully
to observe and to appreciate the

build into the structure of his manhood
the high and abiding influences that come
to his hands. As one of our great
thinkers given to deep introspection has
so impressively said, life, itself, may be
compared to a building in the course of
construction. It rises slowly, day by
day, through the years. Every new lesson
we learn lays a block on the edifice
which is rising silently within us. Every
experience, every touch of another life
on ours, every influence that impresses
us, every book we read, every conversation
we have, every act of our commonest
days adds to the invisible building.</p>

<p>Plenty of good, wholesome play and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
healthful recreation, every boy needs and
must have if he means to round out a
fine physical and moral development, but
idleness and indifference, evils that creep
into the hours that are given up to something
that is neither work nor play, must
never be tolerated. &ldquo;The ruin of most
men dates from some vacant hour,&rdquo; says
Hillard. &ldquo;Occupation is the armor of
the soul; and the train of Idleness is borne
up by all the vices. I remember a satirical
poem, in which the devil is represented
as fishing for men and adapting
his baits to the taste and temperament of
his prey; but the idler, he said, pleased
him most, because he bit the naked hook.
To a young man away from home,
friendless and forlorn in a great city, the
hours of peril are those between sunset

more of evil in a single hour than the

bring the wanderer to his home, the child

and the weary laborer to his rest. But

evening brings with it an aching
sense of loneliness and desolation,
which comes down upon the spirit like
darkness upon the earth. In this mood
his best impulses become a snare to him;
and he is led astray because he is social,
affectionate, sympathetic, and warm-hearted.
If there be a young man thus
circumstanced within the sound of my
voice, let me say to him, that books are
the friends of the friendless, and that a
library is the home of the homeless. A
taste for reading will always carry you
into the best possible society, and enable
you to converse with men who will instruct
you by their wisdom, and charm
you with their wit; who will soothe you
when fretted, refresh you when weary,
counsel you when perplexed, and sympathize
with you at all times.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is from good books as well as from
living personages that boys will receive
much of the good advice which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
must follow in order that they may make
the most of life. Life is too short for a
boy to investigate everything for himself.
There is much that he must accept as
being true. He has not the time to
follow every road to its end and ascertain
if the sign-posts have all told the
truth. Strive as we may we are still dependent
for much of our information
upon the hearsay of others. No one person
can begin to know everything.</p>

<p>Every thinking boy clearly understands
that he knows much more to-day than
he did a year ago. And he has good
reason for thinking that if he shall remain
among the living he will know
many things a year from now that he
does not know to-day. To live is to learn.
Hence it is that youth should be modest
in the presence of age, for silver hair and
wisdom are more than likely to dwell
together. No youth should think too
lightly of his own mental endowments
and his fund of information, neither
should he permit his very lack of knowledge
to lead him to think that he has
acquired about all the secrets that nature
and the great world have to divulge.
Every boy should be cool-headed, clear-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>headed,
long-headed, level-headed, but
not big-headed. Should he become afflicted

<p>This somewhat overdrawn picture of
human conceit and egotism holds a lesson
for each and all of us. He who knows
it all can learn no more, and he who
can learn no more is likely to die ignorant.
There are guide-posts all along our
ways which if heeded will direct us toward
the very destinations we should
reach. And nothing else is so full of
suggestion and inspiration as is a good
book. In it we can enter the very heart
of a man without being abashed by the
author&rsquo;s august presence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Duty determines
destiny. Destiny
which results from
duty performed may
bring anxiety and perils,
but never failure
and dishonor.&mdash;<span class="smcap">William
McKinley.</span></div>

<p>When quite young, the poet, Cowley,
happened upon a copy of Spenser&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Faerie Queen&rdquo;, which chanced to be
nearly the only book at hand, and becoming
interested he read it carefully
and often, until, enchanted thereby, he
irrevocably determined to be a poet.
The effect this same poem had upon
the Earl of Southampton when he first
read it is worth remembering. As soon
as the book was finished Spenser took
it to this noble patron of poets and sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
it up to him. The earl read a few pages
and said to a servant, &ldquo;Take the writer
twenty pounds.&rdquo; Still he read on, and
presently he cried in rapture, &ldquo;Carry
that man twenty pounds more.&rdquo; Entranced
he continued to read, but presently
he shouted: &ldquo;Go turn that fellow
out of the house, for if I read further
I shall be ruined!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Laziness travels so
slowly that poverty
soon overtakes him.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Franklin.</span></div>

<p>Dr. Franklin tells us that the chance
perusal of De Foe&rsquo;s &ldquo;Essay on Projects&rdquo;
influenced the principal events and course
of his life. The reading of the &ldquo;Lives
of the Saints&rdquo; caused Ignatius Loyola
to form the purpose of creating a new
religious order,&mdash;which purpose eventuated
in the powerful society of the
Jesuits.</p>

<div class="sidenote">It is faith in something
and enthusiasm
for something that
makes a life worth
looking at.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Oliver
Wendell Holmes.</span></div>

<p>Dickens&rsquo;s earliest and best literary
work, the &ldquo;Pickwick Papers,&rdquo; was begun
at the suggestion of a publisher of a
magazine for whom Dickens was doing
some job-work at the time. He was
asked to write a serial story to fit some
comic pictures which chanced to be in
the publisher&rsquo;s possession.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Blessed is he who
has found his work.
From the heart of the
worker rises the celestial
force, awakening
him to all nobleness,
to all knowledge.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Thomas
Carlyle.</span></div>

<p>While yet a mere boy Scott chanced
upon a copy of Percy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Reliques of Ancient
Poetry,&rdquo; which he read and re-read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
with great interest. He purchased a
copy as soon as he could get the necessary
sum of money and thus was early
instilled into his soul a taste for poetry
in the writing of which he was destined
to attain such eminence. The translation
of &ldquo;Götz von Berlichingen&rdquo; was
Scott&rsquo;s first literary effort and this work,
Carlyle says, had a very large and lasting
influence on the great novelist&rsquo;s future
career. In his opinion this translation
was &ldquo;the prime cause of &lsquo;Marmion&rsquo;
and the &lsquo;Lady of the Lake,&rsquo; with
all that has followed from the same creative
hand. Truly a grain of seed that
had lighted in the right soil. For if not
firmer and fairer, it has grown to be
taller and broader than any other tree;
and all nations of the earth are still
yearly gathering of its fruit.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">A good book is the
precious life-blood of

<p>Thus we see how much there is in
life for those who observe their surroundings,
who read the directions on
the guide-posts, who study the guidebooks
and who are wise enough to receive
and to utilize the advice and suggestions
that are everywhere offered
them, and which their reason tells them
are good.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boy Wanted&rdquo;</p>

<p>Are you the boy?</p>

<p>If you have carefully read and digested

<div class="sidenote">They also serve

<p>In studying the history of the lives of
successful men we are constantly being
impressed with the thought that they
make the most out of their surroundings,
whatever their surroundings may be.
They do not wait for a good chance to
succeed; they take such chances as they
can get and make them good. We very
soon learn that</p>

<p>We learn, also, that one may achieve
a full measure of success without accumulating
much money, and may accumulate
much money without achieving
success. &ldquo;Mere wealth is no more success
than fools&rsquo; gold is real gold,&rdquo; says
one of our wise essayists. &ldquo;Collaterals
do not take the place of character. A
man obtains thousands or millions of
dollars by legal or illegal thieving, and
society, instead of sending him to prison,
receives him in its parlors. Men bow
low when he passes, as in the fable the
people bowed to the golden idols that
were strapped on the back of a donkey,
who was ass enough to swell with pride
in the thought that all this reverence was
for him. The man who puts his trust in
gold and deposits his heart in the bank,
and thinks money means success, is like
the starving traveler in the desert, who,
seeing a bag in the distance, found in it,
instead of food which he sought, nothing
but gold, and flung it from him in disappointment,
and died for want of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>thing
that could save his life. The soul
will starve if gold alone administers to
its needs. Better to be a man than merely
a millionaire. Better to have a head and
heart than merely houses and lands.&rdquo;</p>
